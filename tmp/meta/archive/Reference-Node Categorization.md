# Reference-Node Categorization
This page is out of date, and will be removed soon.

What follows is an enumeration of the different node categories and subcategories, and expected content within. The categorization system presented is specialized for cryptography.

## Things to address:
- How this node differs for All/Developer/Researcher Audiences
- What sections should all nodes of this category have?

## working list of node types:
This list is subject to change. The node categorization system has grown to include examples of:
- topic
- object
- algorithm
- property
- term
- aphorism
- attack-type
- security model
- theorem
- lemma
But should incorporate 

## Object Types
Likely sections:
- Intro
    - Visual object model (mermaid)
    - date introduced, with source; and if applicable, date broken/deprecated with source
    - Key definitions, informally stated
- Relation to similar objects
- Attacks
- Related Links 
    - Highlighted best pedagogical link
    - Abstractions over this object
    - Ancestors and successors to this object
- In depth (bifurcate out researcher and developer nodes if exceeding 500 words):
    - historical information
    - researcher-directed content
        - formal definitions
        - relevant theorems
        - security model
        - conjecture and discussion
    - developer directed content
        - common APIs
        - libraries
        - implementation details
- References
