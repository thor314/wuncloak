# Security Model-Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)
A **Chosen Ciphertext Attack Model** is a [ECB Mode of AES](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Black-box Model|black-box model]] in which the adversary is given access to any plaintext-ciphertext pair of their choosing, and attempts to derive the key. The adversary may ask an [Oracle]] to encrypt any plaintext or decrypt any ciphertext. Though the CCA model is stronger than the [Ciphertext-Only Attack (COA)|COA]], [[Security Model-Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)|KPA]], or [[Security Model-Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA)|CPA]] models, an encryption scheme that is secure in the CCA model may still be insecure to [[Attack-Statistical Analysis|statistical analysis](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Oracle]] to encrypt any plaintext or decrypt any ciphertext. Though the CCA model is stronger than the [[Security Model-Ciphertext-Only Attack (COA)|COA]], [[Security Model-Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)|KPA]], or [[Security Model-Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA)|CPA](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Ciphertext-Only Attack (COA)|COA]], [[Security Model-Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)|KPA]], or [[Security Model-Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA)|CPA]] models, an encryption scheme that is secure in the CCA model may still be insecure to [[Attack-Statistical Analysis|statistical analysis](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Oracle]] to encrypt any plaintext or decrypt any ciphertext. Though the CCA model is stronger than the [[Security Model-Ciphertext-Only Attack (COA)|COA]], [[Security Model-Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)|KPA]], or [[Security Model-Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA)|CPA) models, an encryption scheme that is secure in the CCA model may still be insecure to [[Attack-Statistical Analysis|statistical analysis); the [[Encryption Scheme-AES#ECB Mode) is a typical example.
