# Algorithm-Extended Euclidean Algorithm
For positive integers $a,b$, the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** obtains values for $u,v$ satisfying:
$$au+bv=\gcd(a,b)$$
That is, we may obtain $\gcd(a,b)$ as a linear combination of $a,b$; that is, $u,v$ always exist. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm runs as an additional step following the [Euclidean Algorithm](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Euclidean Algorithm).
