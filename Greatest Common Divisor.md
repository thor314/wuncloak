# Property-Greatest Common Divisor
For $a,b\in \mathbb Z$, if there exists some positive integer $d$ such that $d\mid a$ and $d\mid b$, then we call $d$ a **common divisor**. The **greatest common divisor** of $a,b$ is the largest value $d$ dividing $a$ and $b$. This is written $d=\gcd(a,b)$.

It is typical to define $\gcd(0,a)=a$.
