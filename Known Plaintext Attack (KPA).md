# Security Model-Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)
The **Known Plaintext Attack Model** is a weak adversary model, in which the adversary is given a set of ciphertext-plaintext pairs, and aims to decrypt further encrypted communications. The KPA model is stronger than the [CCA](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Ciphertext-Only Attack (COA)|COA]] model, but weaker than the [Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA)|CPA](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA)|CPA), and [[Security Model-Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)) adversary models, and is not commonly used for modern encryption analysis.
