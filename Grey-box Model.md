# Security Model-Grey-box Model
A **Grey-box Model**, in contrast to a [white-box](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Black-box Model|Black-box model]], allows an attacker to observe or possess some of the internal workings of a system, in addition to observing the inputs and outputs of the system as with a black-box model. Grey box testing is typically used to approximate what a resourceful attacker in the real world may be able to obtain, typically including at least the binary or hardware, and potentially also source code and design documents. A [[Security Model-White-box Model) adversary is given all details of the system, a grey-box adversary may obtain some, or potentially all details of the system.
