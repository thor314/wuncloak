# Topic-Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
PKI is a system for managing certificates of public-key authentication, preventing [signing](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Man In The Middle (MITM)|Man in the Middle]] attacks. In the PKI system, each user registers their public-key with a centrally trusted [Certificate Authority|certificate authority (CA)](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Certificate Authority|certificate authority (CA)): they must prove ownership of the public-key, which they may do by [[Topic-Signatures) a message. The CA returns a certificate, the CA's own signature of the user's public key. The user may then demonstrate ownership of their public-key by showing the certificate to other users.

To reduce risk that a CA may be compromised, PKI systems maintain several levels of CAs. The top level root-CA issues certificates for lower-level CAs. The lower level CAs interact with users. Users may regularly check that the lower level CA is still trustworthy with the root CA.

A(Root CA) --certifies--> B(User CA 1)
A(Root) --certifies--> C(User CA 2)
C <-..-> D(user)
C <-..-> E(user)
B <-..-> F(user)
B <-..-> G(user)
```

## Alice and Bob prevent a man-in-the-middle attack
Without the CA, Alice might intend to talk to Bob, but her messageskey may be intercepted and manipulated by Eve in a man-in-the-middle attack.
```mermaid
flowchart LR
A(Alice) -.Hey Bob, establish secret?.-> E(Eve)
E -.Hey Bob, establish secret? <3 Alice.-> B(Bob)
B -.Sure Alice. .-> E
E -.Sure Alice. <3 Bob.-> A
```

Without an initial authentication mechanism, Alice has no guarantee that the party she initiates is actually Bob. Alice may first authenticate Bob by asking for Bob's certificate that he is actually Bob. Alice may verify Bob's certificate with her stored copy of the CA's public key.
