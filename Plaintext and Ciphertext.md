# Term-Plaintext and Ciphertext
Plaintext is unencrypted data. Plaintext historically describes human-readable text data, but is inclusive of other machine-readable data types: audio, video, program binaries, etc.

Ciphertext is encrypted data. If the encryption system is [secure](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Cryptographically Secure), the adversary should find that:
- [Indistinguishable (IND)](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Indistinguishability (IND)) - the ciphertext is indistinguishable from randomness
- [Non-malleable (NM)](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Non-Malleability (NM) ) - the adversary gains no information about other ciphertext-plaintext pairs.

Plaintext is typically one of two or more inputs to an encryption algorithm
