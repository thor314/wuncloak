# Security Assumption-Ciphertext Only Attack
A weak encryption security model where the adversary may have the ability to intercept [secure](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Plaintext and Ciphertext|ciphertext]] in-transit ([Ciphertext Only Attack|ciphertext only attack]]), but a strong adversary may be able to ask a [Oracle|black-box oracle]] to decrypt any ciphertext or encrypt any plaintext [[Security Model-Chosen Ciphertext Attack|Chosen Ciphertext Attack](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Ciphertext Only Attack|ciphertext only attack]]), but a strong adversary may be able to ask a [[Term-Oracle|black-box oracle](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Oracle|black-box oracle]] to decrypt any ciphertext or encrypt any plaintext [[Security Model-Chosen Ciphertext Attack|Chosen Ciphertext Attack](https://wiki.uncloak.com/Ciphertext Only Attack|ciphertext only attack]]), but a strong adversary may be able to ask a [[Term-Oracle|black-box oracle) to decrypt any ciphertext or encrypt any plaintext [[Security Model-Chosen Ciphertext Attack|Chosen Ciphertext Attack). The latter model may seem paradoxical--the adversary can already decrypt any ciphertext--but if the adversary still cannot retrieve the secret key given these advantages, then the encryption system is demonstrably [[Term-Cryptographically Secure).
